//For this Counting Semaphore demo, we are creating a library of books. 
//One book can be issued to only one reader at a time. The other readers
//can get books only when the more books are available or the books are
//retuned back to library by the readers who has already issued.
//The number of readers is more than the number of books in our scenario.
//What all we want is issue the books to readers if available otherwise
//hold on till the books are retuned back to the library. 

//This example is taken from:
